2. Connect adjustable feet or castor wheels to the bottom of the twin slot profiles.
3. Connect the Twin Slot Profiles with Tie Bars and the required Nuts & Bolts. If you are alone, we recommend conducting step 2 on the ground.
4. Tip the unit over and connect feet or castor wheels to the threaded holes in the bottom
5. Set the unit up again.
